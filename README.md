# SyncChess

SyncChess is an innovative chess variant where both players submit their moves simultaneously instead of taking turns. This creates a unique strategic experience that combines traditional chess knowledge with prediction, mind games, and risk assessment.

## Game Rules

### Core Mechanics

1. **Simultaneous Moves**: Both players submit their moves at the same time. There are no turns; each round consists of one move per player, executed simultaneously.

2. **No Repeating the Same Piece**: A piece cannot be moved two turns in a row, with one exception: the king can move multiple times in a row if it is in check or if there are no other legal moves available.

3. **"Swerving" Rule**: If a piece tries to capture an enemy piece, but that piece moves away in the same turn, no capture occurs. Both pieces simply move to their new destinations as if nothing happened.

4. **Collision Rule**: If two pieces move to the same square at the same time, both are removed from the board.

### Check & Checkmate

- A king cannot move into a square that is already under threat (standard chess rule).
- If a king ends up in check due to the opponent's simultaneous move, that's allowed.
- If a player is in check, they must get out of it on their next move.
- If both kings are in check at the same time, both players must escape check in the next round.
- If a player delivers checkmate, the game ends immediately, even if that player also ends up in check on the same turn.
- If both players deliver checkmate at the same time, the game ends in a draw.

### Special Moves

- **Castling**: Works as in standard chess but with simultaneous moves.
- **En Passant**: Standard chess rules apply.
- **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
- **King's Extra Move**: Kings can move multiple times in a row when in check.

## Technical Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Built using Socket.io for seamless real-time gameplay.
- **Customizable Time Controls**: Options from 1 minute to 60 minutes, or unlimited time.
- **Move Validation**: Server-side validation ensures all moves follow the rules.
